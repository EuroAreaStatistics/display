## What is Cookie Consent?

[Cookie Consent][cl] is a lightweight JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.

It is designed to help you quickly comply with the EU Cookie Law. So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.

Cookie Consent is seen over 2 BILLION times every month and is used on millions of sites, making this the by far most popular consent project on the Internet.

We welcome community contributions and actively review pull requests.

## Version 3.1

Reflects the ownership change of the Cookie Consent project. Now actively maintained by:

- @arlogilbert
- @L0key
- @pgoforth
- @relicmelex

## Version 3.0

Version 3.0 is a complete rewrite from version 2. The most substantial new features are:

- Ability to GeoLocate and only show the addon to people in the relevant countries
- Callback hooks for showing/accepting/revoking the banner
- Support for different types of compliance, giving you the flexibility to obey even the strictest cookie laws
- Easy no-fuss themes and customisable styles

The easiest way to develop is to host the files with a local webserver. e.g.

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

We use Babel, Terser, and PostCSS to compile the SCSS and minify the JavaScript. You can run a build with:

```sh
npm run build
```

or

```sh
yarn run build
```
